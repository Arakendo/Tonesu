# Word Formation

## Status: Draft

---

## Core Principle

Words are not looked up — they are built. The system is generative: a speaker who knows the primitives and rules can construct and interpret unfamiliar words without a dictionary.

---

## Compound Order Rule

**Head-final: modifier precedes core concept.**

```
[modifier] + [core concept]
```

For multi-part compounds:
```
[domain/class] + [function] + [head concept]
```

Examples:
```
knowledge + store + object   →  "memory device / database"
person + build + maintain    →  "engineer"
energy + change + process    →  "propulsion"
```

The last element is the semantic head. Listeners parse left-to-right, narrowing the concept at each step.

---

## Derivational Markers

Short suffix syllables that shift a root into a different lexical role. Regular, no exceptions.

| Suffix | Role | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| `-li` | agent (one who does) | build-li → builder |
| `-mu` | device/instrument | build-mu → building tool |
| `-pa` | location | build-pa → construction site |
| `-su` | result/state | build-su → structure / what was built |
| `-to` | abstract concept | build-to → the concept of construction |
| `-se` | quality/property | energy-se → energetic |
| `-ki` | ongoing process | build-ki → the act of building (verbal noun) |

Derivational suffixes attach directly to the root without a separator.

## Word Formation Pathways

Every lexical item enters the language through one of five pathways:

**Path 1 — Primitive root**
Reserved for foundational meanings. Closed set. New primitives require strong justification.

**Path 2 — Regular derivation**
Known root + derivational suffix. Fully predictable.
```
su (structure) + -li  →  suli  (architect / one who organizes structure)
```

**Path 3 — Semantic compounding**
Two or more roots combined by the compound order rule.
```
to (knowledge) + su (structure) + -mu  →  tosu-mu  (knowledge system / organized information device)
```

**Path 4 — Domain registration**
A conceptual namespace declared using the domain creation rule (see ontology/domains.md).
Compounds inside a domain may reference the domain root implicitly.

**Path 5 — Exceptional adoption**
Borrowed proper terms, culturally anchored words. Explicitly marked as non-compositional.
Rare. Must still fit phonology.

## Ambiguity Resolution Rules

When multiple valid constructions exist for a concept, prefer in this order:

1. Function over appearance
2. Ontological category over metaphor (in formal register)
3. Existing domain compound before new root
4. Shortest valid unambiguous form

Example: "computer" could be built as `thought-device`, `logic-device`, `information-process-device`.
The preferred canonical form is registered in lexicon/roots.md. Alternates may be listed.

## Lexical Status Tiers

| Tier | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Compositional-possible | Constructible by rule, not yet standardized |
| Accepted-standard | Reviewed and recommended |
| Lexicalized | Frequent enough to have a contracted colloquial form |
| Deprecated | Replaced by a better construction |

---

## Contraction and Compression Rules

Formal compounds may contract into shorter spoken forms over time. Compression is allowed when:

- The formal compound is at least 3 morphemes long
- The short form is unambiguous within its domain
- The formal form remains the canonical entry in the lexicon

Compression pattern:
```
Formal:     knowledge-store-device
Standard:   knowstore-device
Colloquial: nosta
```

Colloquial forms are recorded in lexicon/colloquial.md and must trace back to their formal source.

---

## Entry Schema

Every compound registered in the lexicon uses this format:

```
ID:           unique identifier
Form:         canonical phonetic form
Orthography:  written form
Type:         primitive | particle | derivation | compound | domain | borrowed
Class:        entity | process | quality | relation | domain
Definition:   concise core meaning
Composition:  root breakdown (if derived)
Semantic bounds:
  includes:   ...
  excludes:   ...
Grammar:      what it modifies, where it may appear
Register:     formal | standard | colloquial | technical
Domain:       general | [named domain]
Examples:     2–5 sample usages
Related:      synonyms, narrower, broader, contrasts
Status:       proposed | accepted | lexicalized | deprecated
```

## Open Questions

- [ ] Decide separator convention at compound boundaries (none, hyphen in writing, pause in speech)
- [ ] Define maximum compound length before compression is required
- [ ] Confirm suffix order when multiple derivational markers stack
