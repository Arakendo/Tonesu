# CVC Descriptor Inventory: Digits, Colors, Scale Prefixes

## Status: Proposed — March 2026

Working document. Forms here are candidates. None are formally registered until registry entries are created.

---

## Purpose

Three closed-class descriptor categories — numerals (digits 0–9), basic colors, and SI-style magnitude scale prefixes — are assigned to the **CVC phonological stratum**. This follows the design rationale in `notes/numbers-colors-others.md`:

- CV = primitives (closed set)
- CV-CV+ = compounds (open, compositional)
- CVC = lexical descriptors (closed-class, fast-recognition)

CVC forms are phonologically stratified from primitives and compounds, giving instant category recognition and avoiding collision with the existing root inventory.

---

## Design Constraints

All forms must satisfy:

1. **CV stem must be free** — first two characters must not form any taken primitive, particle, pronoun, or derivational marker. The audit table is in `spec/phonology.md §CV Space Audit`. Note: that audit counts 33 roots; `zi` (R034) was added afterward and its CV stem is now taken.
2. **Coda from the safe set** — preferred: `n l r m s`. Marked but allowed: `z f h`. Stops (`k p t b d g`) are legal per syllable rules but ranked lower for cross-linguistic ease and spec preference.
3. **No consonant clusters** — CVC only. Forms like `blu`, `grn`, `blk` are English abbreviations that violate the no-CC-cluster rule and are not valid Tonesu syllables.
4. **Cross-set distinctiveness** — no two forms across all three inventories should be near-homophones (differ by only one phoneme with the same CV stem).

---

## Structural Rules

These govern how CVC descriptors integrate with existing grammar. No new primitives are required.

### Counting

```
[digit] nu [noun]
```

```
bol nu mu         → one object
bun nu zo         → two organisms
bun gal nu li     → twenty-three agents   (positional chain, most-significant first)
```

### Ordinals

```
[digit] ti        → [nth] in sequence
```

```
bol ti            → first
bun ti            → second
gal ti            → third
```

### Large number chaining

Digits chain positionally before `nu`, most significant first:

```
wes nil nil nu mu  → six hundred objects
```

*No explicit hundred/thousand words yet — positional chaining handles it. See FLAG-CVC-003.*

### Base units as compounds

Base SI units do not need CVC forms. The domain primitive **is** the unit label — `nu [domain]` means "a quantity of [domain]", which is exactly what a base unit expresses. No new vocabulary is required.

| Tonesu compound | Reading | SI equivalent |
|-----------------|---------|---------------|
| `nu pa`  | quantity of space    | meter (distance) |
| `nu ti`  | quantity of time     | second (duration) |
| `nu ma`  | quantity of matter   | kilogram (mass) |
| `nu ha`  | quantity of heat     | kelvin (temperature) |
| `nu lu`  | quantity of light    | candela (luminous intensity) |
| `nu ra`  | quantity of force    | newton / joule family |
| `nu so`  | quantity of sound    | decibel register |
| `nu si`  | quantity of signal   | bit / information unit |

The full measurement expression stacks cleanly:

```
[digit] [scale] nu [domain]
```

```
bol nu pa              → 1 meter
pir nu pa              → 1 kilometer
bun gal nu ti          → 23 seconds
gal nu ma              → 3 kilograms      (gal pir nu ma for 3 kg precisely)
mes nu pa              → 1 micrometer
```

**Derived units** (those defined as combinations of base units — newton, joule, pascal, watt) are expressed as multi-domain compounds. They do not receive separate names unless corpus pressure demands a shortform. Examples:

```
ra ne ma-ki            → force in relation to matter-in-motion    (≈ newton)
ra ne pa               → force in relation to space               (≈ joule)
```

**The only units that require CVC forms** are observational/conventional anchors — distances or quantities defined by physical measurement rather than derived from conceptual primitives (AU, light-year, mole, ampere-equivalent). Those use the CVC anchor forms in the Astronomical Distance Anchors section below.

---

### Scale-prefixed measurement

```
[scale] nu [domain]
```

```
pir nu ma         → kilo-scale quantity of matter      (≈ kilogram)
mes nu ti         → micro-scale time                   (≈ microsecond)
baf nu ra         → mega-scale energy                  (≈ megajoule)
bim nu si         → pico-scale signal quantity         (≈ picofarad register)
```

Base unit takes no scale prefix — bare `nu` is the base form:

```
bun nu ra         → two units of force (base scale)
```

### Color as modifier

Head-final rule applies; color word precedes the noun it modifies:

```
[color] [noun]
```

```
ker mu            → red object
gim zo            → green organism
pom su            → blue structure
```

Color intensity via existing `vo-be` / `vo-de`:

```
ker vo-be         → bright red
pom vo-de         → dark blue
```

Color blending via `zi` (mutual/coupling):

```
ker zi pom        → red interacting with blue    (purple register)
gim zi sam        → green-yellow blend           (lime register)
```

Color gradient via `ki` (motion/change):

```
ker ki pom        → transitioning red-to-blue    (spectral gradient)
```

### Atomic and molecular compounds

Subatomic and chemical-structure concepts compose from existing primitives — no CVC forms needed.

| Concept    | Compound    | Reading |
|------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| particle   | `pe-ma`     | component of matter |
| atom       | `ru-pe-ma`  | singular / irreducible component of matter |
| molecule   | `su-ma`     | structured matter |
| element    | `fe-ma`     | bounded / categorically distinct matter |
| ion        | `ma-ra`     | matter in an energy / force state |
| compound   | `su-fe-ma`  | structured, categorically distinct matter |

These use the standard compound slot before `nu` where counting is needed: `bun nu ru-pe-ma` = two atoms.

**Conventional anchor exception:** The mole (6.022×10²³ particles) is a defined-by-convention counting unit, not derivable from primitives. It requires a CVC anchor form — see FLAG-CVC-007.

### Probability with digits

From the probability stress test (notes/open-questions.md):

```
wes nu-to         → 60% confidence
zan zan nu-to     → 99% confidence
```

## Digit Inventory

All 8 forms from `spec/phonology.md §CVC Root Reserve shortlist` are used here for digits 1–8. The spec shortlist note ("No form assigned yet, March 2026") should be updated when these are committed.

| Digit | Form  | CV stem | Coda | Notes |
|-------|-------|---------|------|-------|
| 0     | `nil` | `ni`    | l    | minor echo of Latin *nil* = nothing; acceptable |
| 1     | `bol` | `bo`    | l    | spec shortlist |
| 2     | `bun` | `bu`    | n    | spec shortlist |
| 3     | `gal` | `ga`    | l    | spec shortlist |
| 4     | `mol` | `mo`    | l    | spec shortlist — fast-speech blur risk with `bol` (1); fallback `mor` reserved if confusion emerges in practice |
| 5     | `hin` | `hi`    | n    | spec shortlist |
| 6     | `wes` | `we`    | s    | spec shortlist |
| 7     | `yom` | `yo`    | m    | spec shortlist |
| 8     | `fon` | `fo`    | n    | spec shortlist |
| 9     | `zan` | `za`    | n    | free CV, not in shortlist |

**Spoken sequence:** nil · bol · bun · gal · mol · hin · wes · yom · fon · zan

## Color Inventory

Core set covers the six typologically primary/neutral points. Extended set covers secondary colors; all three can be deferred since they compose from core colors via `zi`.

### Core

| Color  | Form  | CV stem | Coda | Notes |
|--------|-------|---------|------|-------|
| black  | `yel` | `ye`    | l    | |
| white  | `yim` | `yi`    | m    | |
| red    | `ker` | `ke`    | r    | |
| green  | `gim` | `gi`    | m    | |
| blue   | `pom` | `po`    | m    | |
| yellow | `sam` | `sa`    | m    | |

### Extended (can be deferred)

| Color  | Form  | CV stem | Coda | Notes |
|--------|-------|---------|------|-------|
| orange | `tem` | `te`    | m    | compositional alt: `ker zi sam` |
| purple | `dol` | `do`    | l    | compositional alt: `ker zi pom` |
| brown  | `kus` | `ku`    | s    | |

**Note on prior colloquial anchors:** `lu-ra` (≈red), `lu-zo` (≈green), `lu-pa` (≈blue) were logged as informal hue expressions (COL-001, open-questions.md). If this CVC set is adopted, those compounds become poetic/informal register only; the CVC forms above are canonical.

---

## Scale Prefix Inventory

SI-style magnitude scale words. Structure: `[scale] nu [domain]`. Base unit (×1) requires no prefix — bare `nu` with the domain is the base form.

### Core (nano through giga)

| Scale | Exponent | Form  | CV stem | Coda | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|---------|------|-------|
| nano  | 10⁻⁹     | `zum` | `zu`    | m    | |
| micro | 10⁻⁶     | `mes` | `me`    | s    | |
| milli | 10⁻³     | `rim` | `ri`    | m    | |
| base  | 10⁰      | *(bare `nu`)* | — | — | no prefix |
| kilo  | 10³      | `pir` | `pi`    | r    | |
| mega  | 10⁶      | `baf` | `ba`    | f    | |
| giga  | 10⁹      | `wul` | `wu`    | l    | |

### Extended (optional)

| Scale | Exponent | Form  | CV stem | Coda | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|---------|------|-------|
| pico  | 10⁻¹²    | `bim` | `bi`    | m    | |
| tera  | 10¹²     | `les` | `le`    | s    | |

### Extended-Extended (astronomical and precision physics)

| Scale  | Exponent | Form  | CV stem | Coda | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|---------|------|---------|
| peta   | 10¹⁵     | `gul` | `gu`    | l    | light-year territory in SI |
| exa    | 10¹⁸     | `fin` | `fi`    | n    | |
| zetta  | 10²¹     | `fus` | `fu`    | s    | |
| yotta  | 10²⁴     | `hem` | `he`    | m    | observable-universe radius in SI |

**Note:** Sub-pico (femto, atto, etc.) are unassigned. After all current assignments, the only two free CV stems remaining in the CVC stratum are `wa` and `wo` — see FLAG-CVC-006.

## Astronomical Distance Anchors

Named reference distances for astronomical-scale discourse. These are **distance unit anchors**, not scale prefixes — they behave like domain words (`ma`, `ti`, `pa`, `ra`) but carry a pre-calibrated scale. They slot into the standard measurement structure:

```
[digit/scale] nu [anchor]
```

| Unit       | Approx SI     | Form  | CV stem | Coda | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|---------|------|---------|
| AU         | 1.5 × 10¹¹ m  | `hon` | `ho`    | n    | solar-system scale; Earth-Sun distance |
| light-year | 9.46 × 10¹⁵ m | `hun` | `hu`    | n    | stellar scale; compositional gloss: `lu-ki-re pa` (light-motion-cycle space) |
| megaparsec | 3.09 × 10²² m | `yam` | `ya`    | m    | cosmological scale; large-structure astronomy |

**Phonetic note:** `hon` and `hun` share the h_n pattern and differ only in vowel (o vs u). In practice they refer to scales five orders of magnitude apart, so context eliminates ambiguity completely. Careful speech makes the vowel distinction clear.

### Structural rules for astronomical expressions

Basic distance:

```
[digit] nu [anchor]
```

```
gal bun nu hun        → 3.2 light-years
bol hin nu hon        → 150 AU            (inner edge of Oort cloud)
bun nu yam            → 2 megaparsecs
```

Scale-prefixed anchor (for very large or very small astronomical distances):

```
[scale] nu [anchor]
```

```
wul nu hun            → giga-light-years  (≈ cosmological survey depth)
```

Digit + scale combined:

```
[digit] [scale] nu [anchor]
```

```
bun wul nu hun        → 2 × 10⁹ light-years    (2 giga-light-years)
```

Mixed: SI precision for physical quantities alongside anchored distances:

```
pir nu ma la ki ne bol hun    → kilo-mass [agent] moves toward one light-year [distance]
```

### Compositional background

`hun` (light-year) has a natural compositional gloss: `lu-ki-re nu pa` (light-motion-cycle quantity of space = distance light travels in one time-cycle). The CVC form is the concise registry name; the compound is the semantically transparent long form. Both are valid; CVC is preferred in measurement expressions.

AU (`hon`) has no clean compositional equivalent — it is the Earth-Sun distance, which is observational rather than derived from primitives. It is therefore a pure named anchor with no compound alternative.

`yam` (megaparsec) is similarly definitional (parsec = parallax second, a measurement-geometry concept). Named anchor only.

---

## Cross-inventory Collision Check

### Uniqueness

All 38 proposed forms are distinct:

> nil bol bun gal mol hin wes yom fon zan  
> yel yim ker gim pom sam tem dol kus  
> zum mes rim pir baf wul bim les  
> gul fin fus hem  
> hon hun yam

No two are identical. ✓

### Near-neighbor analysis (differ by one phoneme within same CV stem)

| Pair | Categories | CV stem | Codas | Verdict |
|------|-----------|---------|-------|---------|
| `bol` / `mol` | digit 1 / digit 4 | bo vs mo | both l | distinct onset ✓ |
| `bun` / `hin` | digit 2 / digit 5 | bu vs hi | both n | distinct onset + vowel ✓ |
| `gal` / `gim` | digit 3 / green | ga vs gi | l vs m | distinct vowel + coda ✓ |
| `mol` / `mes` | digit 4 / micro | mo vs me | l vs s | distinct vowel + coda ✓ |
| `nil` / `rim` | digit 0 / milli | ni vs ri | l vs m | distinct onset + coda ✓ |
| `bun` / `wul` | digit 2 / giga | bu vs wu | n vs l | distinct onset + coda ✓ |
| `bim` / `rim` | pico / milli | bi vs ri | both m | distinct onset + vowel ✓ |
| `mes` / `les` | micro / tera | me vs le | both s | distinct onset + vowel ✓ |
| `yel` / `yim` | black / white | ye vs yi | l vs m | distinct vowel + coda ✓ |
| `hon` / `hun` | AU / light-year | ho vs hu | both n | distinct vowel ✓ — 5 orders of magnitude apart; context always disambiguates |
| `gul` / `wul` | peta / giga | gu vs wu | both l | distinct onset + vowel ✓ |
| `fin` / `hin` | exa / digit 5 | fi vs hi | both n | distinct onset ✓ |
| `fus` / `fon` | zetta / digit 8 | fu vs fo | both f onset | distinct vowel + coda ✓ |
| `hem` / `hin` | yotta / digit 5 | he vs hi | m vs n | distinct vowel + coda ✓ |

No dangerous near-homophones across categories. ✓

### CVC stratum capacity

After all assignments in this document, the free CV-stem count is:

| Stage | Free stems remaining |
|-------|---------------------|
| Before CVC work (minus `zi`) | 36 |
| After digits + colors + scales | 9: `gu fi fu he ho hu ya wa wo` |
| After astronomical additions | **2: `wa` `wo`** |

The CVC stratum is **effectively full**. Any future CVC assignments must be treated as exceptional and require displacing something or accepting a longer phonological form. See FLAG-CVC-006.

## Flags and Open Questions

### FLAG-CVC-001 — `vo` vs. `v`-exclusion inconsistency ✓ RESOLVED

`spec/phonology.md` previously excluded `v` despite `vo` (R024, value/quality) already using it. **Resolution (March 2026): option A adopted — `v` added to the consonant inventory as the 17th consonant.** `spec/phonology.md §Consonant Inventory` updated; total count corrected from 16 to 17; exclusion note updated.

### FLAG-CVC-002 — Spec CVC shortlist fully consumed by digits

All 8 forms from `spec/phonology.md §CVC Root Reserve` shortlist are assigned to digits 1–8. The spec comment ("No form on this list is assigned yet, March 2026") must be updated once these assignments are committed.

### FLAG-CVC-003 — Large number expression

Digit chaining (`wes nil nil nu mu` = 600) is unambiguous but verbose for large numbers in ordinary speech. Options: (a) accept positional chaining only; (b) add explicit power-of-ten words (`ten`, `hundred`, `thousand` equivalents as additional CVC forms); (c) route large exact values through the scale prefix system (`pir nu mu` ≈ thousand objects). Defer until corpus shows a real pressure; log under NUM-001 in open-questions.md.

### FLAG-CVC-007 — Mole and ampere: conventional anchors pending assignment

The **mole** (6.022×10²³ — Avogadro's number of particles) and the **ampere** (defined by elementary charge flow) are SI base units whose values are fixed by measurement convention, not derivable from primitives. Like the AU and light-year, they require CVC anchor forms. Neither is assigned yet.

Problem: the CVC stratum has exactly **two free stems remaining** (`wa` and `wo`). Assigning both mole and ampere would exhaust the tier entirely with no reserve left.

**Deferred until a corpus sentence requires one.** Options when that pressure arrives:
- `wal` or `wam` = mole; `wol` or `won` = ampere (exhausts `wa`/`wo`)
- Accept verbose form in specialist register: `baf bun bun nu pe-ma` (Avogadro-digit chain + matter-component unit) until a shortform is demanded
- Open a secondary CVC pool using stop codas (`-k`, `-p`, `-t`) or `v`-initial stems, which are now legal since `v` was added to the inventory (FLAG-CVC-001 resolved). This would extend the tier rather than exhaust it.

Track alongside NUM-001 in `notes/open-questions.md`.

### FLAG-CVC-006 — CVC stratum near-depletion

After committing all forms in this document, only **`wa` and `wo`** remain as free CVC-stem slots. Any new CVC vocabulary requirement must either: (a) use one of these two final stems; (b) accept a mild CV-stem collision with an existing root and rely on coda + context to disambiguate (lower quality); (c) move to a different phonological tier (CVCC, CV-CVC, or long-vowel forms). This depletion is a direct consequence of the three-domain commitment (digits, colors, scales). Practical implication: **the CVC tier should be considered closed for new general vocabulary from this point**. Future descriptors (temperature scales, angle units, etc.) should be assessed for whether they can be expressed compositionally before claiming a remaining slot.

### FLAG-CVC-005 — Names and loanwords may collide with CVC layer

Proper names and borrowed vocabulary — personal names, place names, AI system names, titles — have no assigned phonological tier. If ad-hoc CVC forms are used for names, they will be indistinguishable from digit/color/scale descriptors at first glance. **Options:** (a) reserve **CVCC** (CVC + extra coda) or **CV-CVC** (hyphenated compound) as the name/loanword tier; (b) rely on the `na` proper-name particle (G008) to signal context without a separate phonological tier. Option (b) is probably sufficient and lower-complexity. Defer until a corpus sentence requires a proper name; track under `spec/naming.md`.

---

### FLAG-CVC-004 — `nu-to` dual assignment

`nu-to` appears in `registry/primitives.md` stress-test table as both "axis of measurement / dimension" and "probability / confidence level." These are two contextually determined readings of the same compound. **This is intentional and unproblematic** — English does the same thing with *weight* (physical / importance / statistical). Measurement context vs. epistemic context disambiguates reliably. No new primitive, no respelling needed. Document the disambiguation principle in the `nu-to` entry comment for future readers, and cross-reference from NUM-001.
